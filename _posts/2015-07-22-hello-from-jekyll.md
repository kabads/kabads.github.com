I have just started playing around with Jekyll - partly out of frustration with Wordpress. I understand the process of wordpress and how it works, but need to find something that is more geeky and more fun. I've tired of the amount of time that wordpress takes to load and how awkward it can be with security. I like the way jekyll just does something very simple.

So, consider this a test post and a newer way of blogging.
